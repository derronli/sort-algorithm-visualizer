# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web application which helps to better understand sorting algorithms through various animations. \
**Motivation:** Having just built my personal portfolio using HTML/CSS, I wanted to learn a more powerful front-end technology such as React. I was also taking Grow with Google's Data Structures & Algorithms course at the time and so I thought this project would be a perfect.
